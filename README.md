## Description
Given a hard-coded list of student names, meeting slot pattern, and initial start date, generates a calendar of meetings. The page initially opens in overview mode, listing all of the scheduled meetings. By clicking on a date (or by clicking the toggle switch) it switches to a day view. Clicking the grey button on the left displays the page for the previous date, while clicking on the blue button on the right displays the next date. And clicking on the toggle takes the user back ot the calendar view, of course.
